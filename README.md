# Weather Theme

This theme will grab the latest weather conditions from [forecast.io](http://forecast.io) and display them using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) flavor of [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/).

This theme was inspired by [this tutorial](http://themehybrid.com/weblog/intro-to-underscore-js-templates-in-wordpress) from [Justin Tadlock](https://github.com/justintadlock).

#### What's going on here?

With the onset of [WP REST API](http://wp-api.org/), I need to teach myself how to theme/template external API's using WordPress and a MW* framework.

#### Why Forecast.io

Because I love the weather! Plus, their API is very easy to use. You could use any API you wanted though...

#### Can I play too?

Yes! If you'd like to contribute; and learn something along with me... your [issues](https://github.com/gregrickaby/weather-theme/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/gregrickaby/weather-theme/pulls) are welcome! If you do fork this, then please grab your own (Free) Forecast.io [API key](https://developer.forecast.io/). Thanks.
